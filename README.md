In this repository is placed the web app that we call ChatXPress. This project is composed by other three fundamental projects, the one that we are in, the Frontend of the Web, the Backend and the mobile Frontend.

## Library instalation

For the following step is required to have installed node. More information in [this link](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

The first step to execute the app is to be in console mode in the root folder of the project, because we need to execute some commands first.

In the project root folder we execute the following command to install the required libraries:

```shell
npm i
```

## Execute the application

To execute the application we need to execute the next command:

```shell
npm start
```

With this command we will execute the application and it will open automatically in the dault browser on a new tab.
